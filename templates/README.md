# Template Directory

This directory contains the HTML template files used in the [project_name] project. Templates are used to render web pages and present content to the end user. The following is an overview of the structure and use of this directory.

## Folder Structure

The `templates` directory is organized as follows:

- **templates/**
     -**app1/**
         - App related templates 1.
     -**app2/**
         - Application related templates 2.
     - **base.html**
         - The base template that is used as a framework for all pages.
     -**partials/**
         - Reusable template snippets such as headers and footers.

## Using Templates

- **Base Template (`base.html`):** This template serves as a common framework for all pages of the website. Contains the basic HTML structure, such as the navigation bar, header, and footer. Other templates extend this base template to create specific pages.

- **Application Templates:** Each application in the project can have its own directory inside `templates` to organize its templates. These templates are used to render the views and pages specific to each application.

- **Template Snippets (`partials`):** The `partials` directory contains reusable template snippets that can be included in multiple pages. This helps maintain consistency in design and presentation.

## Additional notes

- You can use Django's template system with tags and filters to generate dynamic content in HTML pages.
- Make sure the templates follow web design best practices and are accessible.
